Unofficial Expat's in Peru Website Companion
=================
This google chrome plugin is not endorsed nor has anything to do with expatperu.com's ownership.  It is a work of love and is only a tool that will help with the visualization of the site.  In the future we will add new functionality.

The chrome extension can be found here:  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/forum-title-normalizer/aicholjcgafjdjkbjffcdleoganejhek

Functionality:

Normalize Forum Post Titles - You can choose between 4 different normalization options:  
* lower case
* upper case
* capital/normal case
* crazy case
* Off - turn off all normalizations

Read threads at full screen

Fix large images that break the thread AND lightbox them for easier viewing.  Nice!

Change post title colors

Set to 100% width - beta


Technology used:
*  jQuery for the dom injection and normalization
*  Angularjs for the options page

Planned:
* Refactoring
* Option page design
* Post body normalization option

All contributions welcomed.
